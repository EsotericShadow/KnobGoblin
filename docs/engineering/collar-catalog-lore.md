# Collar Catalog Lore (Model + Thumbnail Ready)

This list covers collar styles that currently exist as both:
- a `.glb` in `/Users/main/Desktop/KnobForge/collar_models`
- a thumbnail image in `/Users/main/Desktop/KnobForge/collar_models/collar_thumbnails`

Use this as naming/lore guidance for the selector and future preset descriptions.

## Industrial and Mechanical

### Gear Teeth
Forge role: the "torque crown."  
Best for knobs that should feel engineered, aggressive, and precise.

### Faux Rivets
Forge role: the "pressure ring."  
Reads as reinforced hardware for aviation, machine-room, and industrial skins.

### Indented Indices (Detents)
Forge role: the "index halo."  
Emphasizes position and repeatability; works well for utility-focused control themes.

## Organic and Flowing

### Art Nouveau Vines
Forge role: the "living filigree."  
Adds elegant movement around the knob body and softens hard industrial forms.

### Wave Collar (Seigaiha-inspired)
Forge role: the "tide ring."  
Gives calm rotational flow and pairs well with smoother lighting profiles.

### Rope Twist or Cable
Forge role: the "helix band."  
High-cadence visual rhythm around the circumference; strong handcrafted-meets-industrial look.

### Laurel Wreath
Forge role: the "victor's ring."  
Ceremonial/classic collar that works for premium, legacy, and commemorative interfaces.

## Cultural and Geometric Patterns

### Celtic Knot Ring
Forge role: the "eternal weave."  
Dense interlock pattern that communicates continuity and complexity.

### Greek Key (Meander)
Forge role: the "architect's trace."  
Structured and classical; ideal for clean, symmetric, high-discipline product lines.

### Geometric Faceting
Forge role: the "cut prism collar."  
Designed to break highlights into discrete flashes as the camera/light shifts.

### Art Deco Burst (Sunburst)
Forge role: the "broadcast crest."  
Vintage-luxury read with strong radial emphasis and stage-like presence.

## Minimalist and Material-Focused

### Hammered Finish
Forge role: the "forged skin."  
Adds artisanal texture without adding silhouette complexity.
